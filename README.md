# Face-Intelligence-COMSYS2025
Welcome to an advanced AI project that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViT) to build a robust gender classification model using facial images. This project applies face detection, feature extraction, transformer-based reasoning, and visual explanation, making it a complete end-to-end pipeline!
