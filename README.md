# Face-Intelligence-COMSYS2025
Welcome to a cutting-edge AI project that fuses the powerful feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViT) to create an intelligent and accurate gender classification system.

Leveraging real-time face detection, advanced image preprocessing, hybrid deep learning architecture, and intuitive visual explanations, this project offers a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline for gender prediction from facial images â€” all designed with scalability, accuracy, and real-world application in mind.
